      "taskTitle": "Configure Package.json with Dependencies and Scripts",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the package.json configuration into distinct phases: file creation, dependency addition, script configuration, validation, and installation testing. Consider error handling for each phase and cross-platform compatibility for file operations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves straightforward package.json configuration with well-defined requirements. The existing 5 subtasks appropriately cover the main aspects: file structure creation, dependency management, script setup, validation, and testing. Complexity is low as it follows standard npm package configuration patterns with clear implementation details provided."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Configure TypeScript with Path Aliases",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the TypeScript configuration process into logical steps: initial file setup, compiler options configuration, path alias implementation, resolution validation, and functionality testing. Consider different module resolution scenarios and edge cases for path mapping.",
      "reasoning": "TypeScript configuration with path aliases requires understanding of module resolution and proper JSON structure. The existing 5 subtasks adequately cover the process from basic setup to validation. The complexity is moderate due to the need for correct compiler options and path mapping, but follows established TypeScript best practices."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Type-Safe Model Registry",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the model registry implementation into type definition, provider-specific array creation, unified array combination, union type generation, and API export phases. Consider type safety validation methods and potential scalability for additional providers.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep understanding of TypeScript's const assertions and type inference. The existing 5 subtasks appropriately cover the progression from type definitions to API exports. Complexity is medium-high due to the need for precise type safety implementation and proper union type creation from const arrays."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Provider Factory",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the factory implementation into model ID parsing, provider identification, individual provider instantiation functions, factory switch logic, exhaustive checking implementation, error handling, and unit testing setup. Consider different error scenarios and provider-specific configurations.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a dynamic factory with exhaustive checking requires careful implementation of switch statements and error handling. The task needs expansion to 7 subtasks to properly cover model parsing, provider instantiation, factory logic, type safety, error handling, and comprehensive testing. Complexity is high due to the dynamic nature and need for exhaustive type checking."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Public API",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the public API implementation into function creation, provider integration, error handling implementation, dotenv configuration, re-export setup, and comprehensive testing. Consider different usage scenarios and proper abstraction layers.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a clean public API requires balancing simplicity with functionality. The task should be expanded to 6 subtasks covering the main function implementation, integration with existing components, error handling, configuration management, exports, and testing. Medium-high complexity due to the need for proper abstraction and error handling."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate LLM Package in Worker",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration process into dependency addition, implementation replacement, testing setup, and validation phases. Consider backward compatibility and error handling during the transition from dummy to real implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Package integration involves dependency management and code replacement. Should be expanded to 4 subtasks covering dependency configuration, implementation changes, testing preparation, and validation. Complexity is moderate as it follows standard package integration patterns but requires careful testing."

      "taskTitle": "Execute Type Checking Validation",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the type checking process into directory navigation, script execution, error identification, error resolution, and final validation phases. Consider different types of type errors and systematic approaches to resolution.",
      "reasoning": "Type checking validation is a systematic process that follows established TypeScript practices. The existing 5 subtasks appropriately cover the workflow from execution to validation. Low complexity as it's a standard verification step, though error resolution may require iterative fixes."
